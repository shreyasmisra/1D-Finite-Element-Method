# 1D-Finite-Element-Method
Various programs are developed for Finite Element Analysis. These programs can also be used for solving basic industry and academic problems. 
Programs included are - <br/>
1) Thermal Analysis with heat generation, heat flux and convection with temperature boundary condition on the inlet and outlet sides. The Heat Transfer rate and unkown temperatures are printed out as result.<br/>
2) Fluid Flow Analysis to calculate velocity and flow rate when the Head of the flow at the boundaries is known. Forces are due to flow sources/sinks and surface flows boundary conditions. <br/>
3) Structural bar element analysis to find the displacement of the system due to external forces including temperature change. The stresses at each node at returned as the result. <br/>
The matrices are solved based on two different methods - Elimination and Penalty methods.<br/>
