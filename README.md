# 1D-Finite-Element-Method
Various programs are developed to help students learn the basics of Finite Element Algorithms. These programs can also be used for solving basic industry and academic problems. 
Programs included are - <br/>
1) Thermal Analysis with heat generation, heat flux and convection with temperature boundary condition on the inlet and outlet sides. The Heat Transfer rate and unkown temperatures are printed out as result.<br/>
2) Fluid Flow Analysis to calculate velocity and flow rate when the Head of the flow at the boundaries is known. Forces are due to flow sources/sinks and surface flows boundary conditions. <br/>
3) Structural bar element analysis to find the displacement of the system due to external forces including temperature change. The stresses at each node at returned as the result. <br/>
4) Structural beam element analysis to find the slope and displacement at the nodes. Force can be due to uniformly distributed or varied load, point load and moment. Boundary conditions include hinged, roller and fixed at the ends of the beam. The results are the displcements and slopes of the beam at each node along with the stresses. <br/>
The matrices are solved based on two different methods - Elimination and Penalty methods.<br/>
